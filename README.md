## Repo Structure and Use

#### What's in here?

- The **curriculum** directory is where you can put your class work!
- Weekly & Daily directories (**curriculum/week-00**) contain in-class code samples and
  files required for labs and lessons.
- The **resources** directory is where you can find all the extra resources you
  can use to learn about programming! This includes:
  - links to outside articles, blog posts, tutorials, and more ways to extend
    your learning or read ahead. You can add your own by submitting a pull-request!
  - The **cheatsheets** directory will be your go-to for cheat sheets and
    procedural instructions (like installs, deployment steps, etc.).
  - The **tangents** folder is where you can find suggestions for extra
    practice -- ideas, prompts, specs, and more. If you need to polish your
    skills in a given area, you'll want to start here!
- The **projects** directory contains information and resources for class
  projects.
- The **exercises** directory contains information for exercises given in class, which
  may have follow-up/after-hours work associated with each exercise. 

#### What can I (student) do in this repository?

As a student, you only have **pull** permissions on this repository. We recommend
creating a "fork" on GitHub that is your own, so that you can also "push" to it.
You should copy ("clone") your fork to your computer, and add a link to the
original version owned by the instructors.

After that, you can get all of the updates in the online repository from the
instructors, work on it on your computer, and back up and share your work on
your own online copy! We will go over this process (or "workflow") in class.

#### What am I viewing here?

You are viewing the README.md file in the current directory. It is written in
[Markdown] [1] -- a plain text formatting syntax which emphasizes readability.
It is recommended that you always have a README.md in the root directory of
your GitHub project. For viewing and editing Markdown files on your
computer, try [MacDown] [2].
