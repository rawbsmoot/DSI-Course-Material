    "Random Forests are some of the most widespread classifiers used.  They are relatively simple to use because they require very few parameters to set and they perform pretty well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have see, Decision Trees are very powerful machine learning models.\n",

    "> Answer:\n",
    "- fast\n",
    "- non parametric\n",
    "- scale independent\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand Decision Trees have some limitations, in particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns: they overfit their training sets. Bagging helps mitigate this problem by exposing different trees to different sub-samples of the whole training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are a further way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance. This comes at the expense of a small increase in the bias and some loss of interpretability, but generally greatly boosts the performance of the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![www.cse.buffalo.edu/~jing/sdm10ensemble.htm](../assets/images/Ensemble.png)\n",

    "**Check:** Describe how the bagging algorithm works:\n",
    "> Answer:\n",
    "- sub sample with replacement\n",
    "- train base models on subsamples\n",
    "- combine prediction by average or majority vote\n",
    "\n",
    "_Random forests_ differ from bagging decision tree in only one way: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each candidate split in the learning process, a **random subset of the features**. This process is sometimes called \"feature bagging\". The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable (target output), these features will be selected in many of the bagging base trees, causing them to become correlated. By selecting a random subset of the features at each split, we counter this correlation between base trees, strengthening the overall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check:** recall what are the two properties base models must satisfy in order for bagging to work well.\n",
    "> Answer: base models must be:\n",
    "- accurate: better than random guessing\n",
    "- diverse: uncorrelated between one another\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, for a classification problem with $p$ features, $\\sqrt{p}$ (rounded down) features are used in each split. For regression problems the inventors recommend $p/3$ (rounded down) with a minimum node size of 5 as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extremely Randomized Trees\n",
    "Adding one further step of randomization yields extremely randomized trees, or _ExtraTrees_. These are trained using bagging and the random subspace method, like in an ordinary random forest, but an additional layer of randomness is introduced. Instead of computing the locally optimal feature/split combination (based on, e.g., information gain or the Gini impurity), for each feature under consideration, a random value is selected for the split. This value is selected from the feature's empirical range (in the tree's training set, i.e., the bootstrap sample), in other words, the top-down splitting in the tree learner is randomized."

    "## Intro to Boosting (15 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "With bagging and random forests we tran models on separate subsets and then combine their prediction. In a sense we are parallelizing the training and then combining (like a map-reduce...).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Boosting_ is a different ensemble technique that is sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BoostingBagging](../assets/images/BoostingVSBagging.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an iterative procedure that adaptively changes the sampling distribution of training records at each iteration, in order to correct the errors of the previous iteration of models. The first iteration uses uniform weights (like bagging) for all samples. In subsequent iterations, the weights are adjusted to emphasize records that were misclassified in previous iterations. The final prediction is constructed by a weighted vote (where the weights for a base classifier depends on its training error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the base classifier's focus more and more closely on records that are difficult to classify as the sequence of iterations progresses, they are faced with progressively more difficult learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting takes a base _weak_ learner and tries to make it a _strong_ learner by re-training it on the misclassified samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several algorithms for boosting, in particular we will mention `AdaBoost`, `GradientBoostingClassifier` that are implemented in scikit learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "`AdaBoost` refers to a particular method of training a boosted classifier. A boost classifier is a classifier in the formula\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F_T(x) = \\sum_{t=1}^T f_t(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where each $f_t$ is a weak learner that takes an object $x$ as input and returns a real valued result indicating the class of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weak learner produces an output, hypothesis $h(x_i)$, for each sample in the training set. At each iteration $t$, a weak learner is selected and assigned a coefficient \\alpha_t such that the sum training error E_t of the resulting t-stage boost classifier is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_t = \\sum_i E[F_{t-1}(x_i) + \\alpha_t h(x_i)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $F_{t-1}(x)$ is the boosted classifier that has been built up to the previous stage of training, $E(F)$ is some error function and $f_t(x) = \\alpha_t h(x)$ is the weak learner that is being considered for addition to the final classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration of the training process, a weight is assigned to each sample in the training set equal to the current error $E(F_{t-1}(x_i))$ on that sample. These weights can be used to inform the training of the weak learner, for instance, decision trees can be grown that favor splitting sets of samples with high weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosting Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is a generalization of boosting to arbitrary differentiable loss functions. GBRT is an accurate and effective off-the-shelf procedure that can be used for both regression and classification problems. Gradient Tree Boosting models are used in a variety of areas including Web search ranking and ecology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of GBRT are:\n",
    "- Natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features)\n",
    "- Predictive power\n",
    "- Robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of GBRT are:\n",
