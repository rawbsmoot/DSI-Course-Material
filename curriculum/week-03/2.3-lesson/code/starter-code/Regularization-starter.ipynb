For our guided practice, let's explore the ridge model that has built-in [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29). Typically cross-validation works by splitting up the dataset and training the model on different subsets, testing on the remaining points.\n",
